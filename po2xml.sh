# This script will convert translated po files back to xml. Before
# running the script, checkout the translation directory from
# https://svn.torproject.org.
#	

### Start config ###

# Location of the translated files, i.e. the path to the orbot
# directory in the translation module. Do not add the trailing slash. 
translated="/home/runa/tor/translation/projects/orbot"

# Location of the orbot directory, i.e. the original English xml file.
# In svn, this should be svn/projects/android/trunk/Orbot/res. Do not add the
# trailing slash.
xml="/home/runa/tor/orbot/res"

### End config ###

# Find po files to convert.
po=`find $translated -type f -name \*.po`

# For every po found, create and/or update the translated manpage.
for file in $po ; do

	# Validate input and write results to a log file
	validate_script="/home/runa/tor/translation/tools/validate.py"
	validate_log="/home/runa/tor/validate/orbot-validate.log"
	python "$validate_script" -i "$file" -l "$validate_log"

	# Get the basename of the file we are dealing with.
	pofile=`basename $file`

	# Strip the file for its original extension and add .xml.
	xmlfile="${pofile%.*}.xml"

	# Figure out which language we are dealing with.
	dir=`dirname $file | sed "s#$translated/##"`
	lang=`basename $dir`

	# The translated document is written if 80% or more of the po
	# file has been translated. Also, po4a-translate will only write
	# the translated document if 80% or more has been translated.
	# However, it will delete the translated txt if less than 80%
	# has been translated. To avoid having our current, translated
	# xml files deleted, convert the po to a temp xml first. If this
	# file was actually written, rename it to xml.

	# Convert translated po to xml.
	function convert {
